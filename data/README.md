Egg donor status is recorded as 0 for non-donor cases, and 1 for egg donor cases. For egg donor cases, maternal age refers to the age of the egg donor. Columns c1-cSex contain aneuploidy calls. The first number in each sequence indicates the inferred number of maternal chromosome copies, the second number indicates the inferred number of paternal chromosome copies, and the third number indicates the inferred number of Y chromosome copies. Columns labelled mbph1-mbphSex are meiotic error indicators, where 1 indicates that both maternal homologs were detected in a single genomic region of the corresponding chromosome. Columns labelled pbph1-pbphSex record inferred meiotic errors of paternal origin. Columns labelled seg1-segSex indicate whether an aneuploidy call refers to the whole chromosome (if 0) or a segmental error (if 1).
